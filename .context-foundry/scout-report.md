## 2. Technology Recommendations

### 2.1 Backend Framework: FastAPI (Recommended over Flask)

**Recommendation: FastAPI**

**Justification:**
1. **Performance:** FastAPI handles 15,000-20,000 requests/second vs. Flask's 2,000-3,000, critical for an API-heavy nutrition tracking application
2. **Async Support:** Native ASGI with async/await enables efficient handling of multiple external API calls (OpenFoodFacts, USDA) without blocking
3. **Auto-Documentation:** Built-in OpenAPI (Swagger) and ReDoc documentation generation saves development time and improves API maintainability
4. **Type Safety:** Pydantic integration provides automatic request/response validation, reducing bugs and improving data integrity
5. **Modern Standards:** Better alignment with 2025 best practices and growing adoption (35-40% YoY growth)
6. **Developer Experience:** Shorter development time for CRUD operations with automatic validation and serialization

**When Flask Might Be Considered:**
- Team has deep Flask expertise and limited time to learn FastAPI
- Project is primarily template-rendered (not applicable here - we're building a REST API)
- Extreme simplicity is prioritized over performance

**Recommended Stack:**
- **Framework:** FastAPI 0.104+
- **ASGI Server:** Uvicorn with Gunicorn for production
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async support
- **Migrations:** Alembic
- **Validation:** Pydantic v2
- **Authentication:** python-jose for JWT, passlib for password hashing
- **Testing:** pytest with pytest-asyncio
- **API Client:** httpx for async API calls to external services

### 2.2 Frontend Libraries and Frameworks

**Core Framework:**
- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Router v6** for navigation

**State Management:**

- **Backend:** Pillow for image processing, S3 or local storage

### 2.3 Database Design Approach

**Recommendation: PostgreSQL 14+**

**Justification:**
- Excellent support for complex queries and joins (essential for nutrition data)
- JSONB support for flexible nutrition data structures
- Full-text search for recipe and ingredient searching
- Robust indexing for performance
- Strong data integrity with foreign keys and constraints
- Mature ecosystem and tooling

**Schema Design Principles:**

1. **Normalization Strategy:** 3NF (Third Normal Form) for core tables
   - Separate tables for users, foods, recipes, ingredients, meals
   - Junction tables for many-to-many relationships (recipe_ingredients, user_favorites)
   - Denormalization only for performance-critical read queries

2. **Core Tables:**

   ```

3. **Indexing Strategy:**
   - Composite indexes on (user_id, date) for meal_logs and water_logs
   - Index on foods.barcode for quick barcode lookups
   - Full-text search index on foods.name and recipes.name
   - Index on foods.source_id for API result caching

4. **Nutrition Data Storage:**
   - **Option A:** Separate columns for common nutrients (simpler queries)
   - **Option B:** JSONB for flexible micronutrient storage (recommended for extensibility)
   - **Hybrid Approach (Recommended):** Macros as columns, micros as JSONB

### 2.4 Third-Party Integrations

#### **OpenFoodFacts API**
- **Rate Limit:** 10 requests/second for search queries
- **Data Quality:** Crowdsourced, variable quality, some missing fields
- **Best For:** International products, European barcodes
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache all successful lookups in local database, 30-day TTL
- **Fallback:** USDA API if OpenFoodFacts returns no results

#### **USDA FoodData Central API**
- **Rate Limit:** 1,000 requests/hour per IP (DEMO_KEY has lower limits)
- **Data Quality:** High quality, government-verified, comprehensive nutrients
- **Best For:** Whole foods, US products, reference data
- **API Key:** Required (free signup at fdc.nal.usda.gov)
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache indefinitely (official data doesn't change often)

#### **Integration Architecture:**
```python
# Recommended flow:
1. User searches/scans -> Check local database first
2. If not found -> OpenFoodFacts API (faster, more products)
3. If still not found -> USDA API (higher quality)
4. Cache all results locally
5. Allow user to create custom food if nothing found
```

#### **Rate Limit Mitigation:**
- Implement Redis caching layer for API responses
- Database-first approach (check local foods table before external APIs)
- Background job for bulk data import during low-traffic periods
- User feedback loop: mark missing/incorrect foods for manual review

### 3.4 State Management Approach

**Zustand Store Structure:**

```typescript
// authStore.ts
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  token: string | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  login: (credentials: LoginCredentials) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  register: (userData: RegisterData) => Promise<void>;
}

// mealLogStore.ts
interface MealLogState {
  logs: MealLog[];
  currentDate: Date;
  dailySummary: NutritionSummary | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  fetchLogs: (date: Date) => Promise<void>;
  addLog: (log: CreateMealLog) => Promise<void>;
  updateLog: (id: string, log: UpdateMealLog) => Promise<void>;
  deleteLog: (id: string) => Promise<void>;
}

// foodStore.ts
interface FoodState {
  searchResults: Food[];
  recentFoods: Food[];
  favorites: Food[];
  isSearching: boolean;
  searchFoods: (query: string) => Promise<void>;
  addToFavorites: (foodId: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

**Persistence Strategy:**
- Auth state persisted to localStorage with encryption
- Recent foods and favorites cached for offline access
- Meal logs synced on connection restore
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure

## 4. Potential Challenges and Mitigations

### 4.1 API Rate Limiting

**Challenge:**
- OpenFoodFacts: 10 requests/second
- USDA: 1,000 requests/hour
- High-traffic periods could exceed limits

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Aggressive Caching:**
   - Redis cache with 30-day TTL for external API responses
   - PostgreSQL as long-term cache for all successful lookups
   - Implement database-first search before hitting external APIs

2. **Request Batching:**
   - Queue non-urgent requests (background recipe enrichment)
   - Process during off-peak hours

3. **Fallback Chain:**
   - Local DB → OpenFoodFacts → USDA → User Input
   - Each step caches results for future requests

4. **Rate Limit Monitoring:**
   - Track API usage in Redis counters
   - Alert when approaching limits (80% threshold)
   - Implement exponential backoff on 429 responses

5. **User Experience:**
   - Show "Searching..." state during API calls
   - Provide manual entry option immediately
   - Pre-populate common foods during setup phase

### 4.2 Barcode Scanning in Browser

**Challenge:**
- Camera access requires HTTPS
- Browser compatibility varies (Safari limitations)
- Limited to 1D barcodes with some libraries
- Scanning accuracy depends on camera quality and lighting

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Library Selection:**
   - Use html5-qrcode for broad barcode type support (1D and 2D)
   - Fallback to manual barcode entry field
   - Progressive enhancement: feature detection before enabling scanner

2. **User Guidance:**
   - Clear instructions and visual feedback during scanning
   - "Aim barcode within frame" overlay
   - Retry mechanism with improved alignment hints

3. **Technical Requirements:**
   - Require HTTPS in production

   - **Phase 3:** Add camera-based scanning for mobile browsers

### 4.3 Complex State Management

**Challenge:**
- Multiple interdependent data types (foods, recipes, meal logs, plans)
- Real-time updates across components
- Offline support requirements
- Performance with large datasets (months of meal logs)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Zustand Store Modularity:**
   - Separate stores by domain (auth, food, mealLog, recipe)
   - Selective subscriptions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Computed selectors for derived data

2. **Data Normalization:**
   - Store entities by ID in maps/objects
   - Reference IDs instead of duplicating objects
   - Use libraries like `normalizr` for API responses

3. **Pagination and Lazy Loading:**
   - Infinite scroll for recipe lists
   - Load meal logs by date range (default: current week)
   - Virtualization for large lists (react-window)

4. **Optimistic Updates:**
   - Update UI immediately, sync in background
   - Rollback on server error with user notification
   - Queue offline actions with background sync

5. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - React DevTools Profiler for render analysis
   - Monitor store updates and component re-renders
   - Memoization with useMemo/useCallback where needed

### 4.4 Database Performance

**Challenge:**
- Complex joins for nutrition aggregation
- Heavy read load for analytics queries
- Large tables over time (meal logs accumulate)
- Real-time calculations for meal plans

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Indexing Strategy:**
   ```sql
   -- Critical indexes
   CREATE INDEX idx_meal_logs_user_date ON meal_logs(user_id, date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_foods_barcode ON foods(barcode);
   CREATE INDEX idx_foods_name_gin ON foods USING gin(to_tsvector('english', name));
   CREATE INDEX idx_recipe_ingredients_recipe ON recipe_ingredients(recipe_id);
   ```

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for slow queries
   - Materialized views for complex analytics
   - Precompute daily summaries in background jobs
   - N+1 query prevention with SQLAlchemy eager loading

3. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Cache daily nutrition summaries in Redis (1-hour TTL)
   - Cache recipe nutrition calculations (invalidate on update)
   - Cache user goals and preferences (24-hour TTL)

4. **Data Archival:**
   - Partition meal_logs table by month/year
   - Archive logs older than 2 years to separate table
   - Aggregate historical data for long-term trends

5. **Read Replicas:**
   - For Phase 4+: separate read replica for analytics
   - Primary DB for writes, replica for heavy read queries
   - Connection pooling with pgBouncer

### 4.5 Data Validation and Quality

**Challenge:**
- Nutrition data varies across sources
- User-entered custom foods may have errors
- Serving size conversions (cups to grams)
- Missing micronutrient data

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Pydantic schemas for all API inputs
   - Reasonable bounds checking (calories 0-5000, protein 0-300g)
   - Required fields vs. optional based on source

2. **Data Source Tracking:**
   - Record source (openfoodfacts, usda, user_custom) for each food
   - Display trust indicator to users
   - Allow users to report incorrect data

3. **Unit Standardization:**
   - Store all nutrition per 100g standard
   - Convert serving sizes on display
   - Provide conversion utilities for common units

4. **Graceful Degradation:**
   - Show available nutrients, hide missing ones
   - Mark incomplete data with warning icons
   - Allow users to supplement missing data

5. **Admin Review Queue:**
   - Flag user-submitted foods for review
   - Crowdsource corrections (Phase 4 feature)
   - Periodic data quality audits

### 4.6 Mobile Responsiveness

**Challenge:**
- Complex drag-and-drop on mobile
- Large data tables (nutrition labels)
- Charts need to be readable on small screens
- Touch targets for small UI elements

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Mobile-First Design:**
   - Design for 375px width first, scale up
   - Touch-friendly targets (min 44x44px)
   - Bottom sheet UI patterns for modals on mobile

2. **Responsive Components:**
   - Calendar switches to list view on mobile
   - Drag-and-drop replaced with tap-to-select on small screens
   - Collapsible nutrition tables with progressive disclosure

3. **Chart Adaptations:**
   - Simplified charts on mobile (fewer data points)
   - Horizontal scroll for time-series data
   - Tap for details instead of hover

4. **Performance:**
   - Code splitting for mobile (lazy load heavy features)
   - Reduced bundle size for mobile network conditions
   - Service worker for offline capability

5. **Testing:**
   - Chrome DevTools device emulation
   - Real device testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
   - Responsive design testing tools

### 4.7 Security Concerns

**Challenge:**
- User health data is sensitive (HIPAA considerations if medical)
- Password security
- XSS and SQL injection vectors
- API token exposure

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Authentication Security:**
   - bcrypt password hashing (12+ rounds)
   - JWT with short expiration (15 minutes access, 7 days refresh)
   - HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens
   - CSRF protection with SameSite cookies

2. **Data Protection:**
   - HTTPS only in production
   - Environment variables for secrets
   - Database encryption at rest
   - PII encryption for sensitive fields

3. **API Security:**
   - Rate limiting per user and per IP
   - Input sanitization with Pydantic
   - Parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM)
   - CORS restricted to frontend domain

4. **Frontend Security:**
   - Content Security Policy headers
   - XSS prevention with React (built-in escaping)
   - Secure token storage (not in localStorage for access tokens)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit, Snyk)

5. **Compliance:**
   - Privacy policy and terms of service
   - GDPR compliance (data export, deletion)
   - Audit logging for sensitive operations
   - Regular security reviews
